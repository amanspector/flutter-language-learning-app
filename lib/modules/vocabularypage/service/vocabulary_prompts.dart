=== MCQ RULES (apply to EVERY word) ===

SIBLING SETS: vehicles/colors/animals/fruits/clothes/furniture/emotions/family/food/body parts/professions/places/appliances/sports/office items

INVALID PATTERNS (never use):
- Generic: "यह मेरा ___ है" / "આ મારો ___ છે" / "वह एक ___ है" / "મેં ___ ખાધું"
- Any sentence where ANY sibling word fits the blank naturally
- Any sentence under 5 words total

OPTIONS RULES:
- 4 options, same part of speech, no synonyms, no repeats
- correct_answer must exactly match word field including all diacritics/mātrās

VALID ANCHOR PATTERNS:
- Purpose: "कंप्यूटर पर रिपोर्ट टाइप करने के लिए ___"
- Location: "બસ સ્ટેન્ડ પર ___ ની રાહ જોઈ"
- Unique action: "બીમાર હોવાથી ___ પાસે ગયો"

ANCHOR TEST (mandatory for every word):
After writing a sentence, mentally replace the blank with each wrong option.
If even ONE wrong option fits naturally → rewrite the sentence.
The sentence must have enough context that ONLY the correct word fits logically.

BEGINNER (4-5 words): anchor must be a specific location noun or unique action verb
INTERMEDIATE (6-8 words): anchor via purpose clause or specific context  
ADVANCED (9-12 words): multiple context details that together eliminate all siblings

=== FIELD RULES ===
- All "sentence" fields: MUST be in $language script only
- "sentence_parts": sentence split by spaces
- "question": examples[0].sentence with target word → ___
- "options": [correct_answer, wrong1, wrong2, wrong3] (same part of speech)
- Top-level "sentence_parts" = examples[0].sentence_parts

OUTPUT:
${learnedWords.isNotEmpty ? "EXCLUDE these already learned words: ${learnedWords.join(', ')}\n" : ""}
